Yet Another Super Mario Bros clone (World 1x1 only) - with a LowRezJam-like resolution (64x64 pixel)

This game/demake was created with the intent of writing some blog posts about it

Graphic (redrawn by me) is heavily based on original Super Mario Bros NES game by Nintendo and game level is a clone of World 1x1 of original game

Since I don't have any rights to the original graphics, I consider my derived graphics to be in the public domain (CC0).

Everything is done with C code, with a simple game framework (app.h by Mattias Gustavsson) that I already used for other little projects.
